# 💧 Water Potability Prediction using KNN

This project uses a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classification model to predict whether water is safe to drink (potable) based on its physicochemical properties. It involves exploratory data analysis, preprocessing, model training, and evaluation using performance metrics.

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Goal:** Classify water samples as potable or not potable.
- **Algorithm Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- **Tools & Libraries:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

## ⚙️ Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**
   - Handling missing values
   - Outlier removal
   - Feature scaling

2. **Model Development**
   - Implemented KNN Classifier using Scikit-learn
   - Trained the model on processed data
   - Optimized hyperparameters (value of K)

3. **Evaluation**
   - Accuracy Score
   - Confusion Matrix
   - Classification Report (Precision, Recall, F1-score)

4. **Visualization**
   - Correlation Heatmap
   - Pair plots
   - Confusion Matrix plot

## 📊 Results
